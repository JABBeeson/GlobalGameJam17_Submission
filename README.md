## Developer Notes
### Conventions
* Name each asset with a shorthand type followed by an underscore and the name.
* Example 1: mat_temp (material called temp).
* Example 2: scene_temp (scene called temp).
* Example 3: script_temp (script called temp).

### Version Management
* Please ensure that you use only your allocated scenes.
* Avoid corruption by not sharing each others scene files.
* Ensure that you pull before pushing any changes.
* If unsure about GitHub, ask Andrew or Liam BEFORE doing anything.
